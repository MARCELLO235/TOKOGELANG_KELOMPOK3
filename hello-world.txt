Task 4a â€“ Key Things to Memorise

Please use code examples to illustrate answers

Libraries and Imports

How do we import MatPlotLib, Pandas, and Numpy?

Import pandas as pd

Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Import numpy as np

Are there any other libraries you know how to import?

Import scrapy as sp

How do we read a CSV file and store it in a dataframe?

Df = pd.read_csv("Task4a_data")

How do we import an Excel file?

Df = pdf.read_excel("Task4a_Data")

Selecting Data

How do we extract all data from one column? What does that leave us with?

type_time_df = df[(df["Post Type"])

two types:

type_time_df = df[(df["Post Type"]) & (df["Time"])]

How do we extract specific data from one column? What does that leave us with?

type_time_df = df[(df["Post Type"] == Choice)

How do we add up row data? What does that leave us with?

adTotalRows = ad_df.sum(axis=1, numeric_only=True)

What do we need to add to avoid summing non-numeric data?

numeric_only=True

How do we add up a final sum of all row data?

finalAD = adTotalRows.sum()

How do we select specific data based upon user input e.g. post type and post time?

type_time_df = df[(df["Post Type"] == Choice) & (df["Time"] == timeframe)]

How do we sum columns of data?

Axis = 0 is column

Axis = 1 is row

ad_df = df[df["Post Type"] == "Advertisement"]

adTotalRows = ad_df.sum(axis=0, numeric_only=True)

finalAD = adTotalRows.sum()

How do we create an average of all row/column data?

def get_avg_data():

    df = pd.read_csv("Task4a_data.csv")

    extract = df.groupby(['Date'], as_index=False)[avg_choice].mean()

    extract_no_index = extract.to_string(index=False)

    print("Here is the average number of {} each day during the campaign:".format(avg_choice))

    return extract_no_index
